Let me tell you about a magical place
Full of wonder
And things that happen
This one goes out to our peers
Columbia is the best school ever
Columbia kids are kind and clever
We'll stay number one forever
Columbia is the best school ever

C-O-L-O-M-B-I-A
We got a UPS store only three minutes away
And not to brag but we have our very own bus station
And got free water bottles at orientation
We got flexible dining plans to fit anyone's social life
On and off campus options
You won't have all too many gripes
Sometimes they have vegan food
Sometimes they have meat
There's even a Nepali place ten minutes down the street
The dorm accommodations are second to none
Like how the John Jay Hall carpet just got replaced on floor one
Constantly striving to hit our eco-friendly goals
We're not there yet, but we got compostable bowls
The alumni network is super strong
Like Paul's friend works at Deloitte Hong Kong
And our internship placements are world-class every summer
Like Rosa worked at Cooper Tire and Rubber

Columbia is the best school ever
Columbia kids are kind and clever
We'll stay number one forever
Columbia is the best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
Best, best, best school ever

We're the party Ivy
That's what they say
Let me tell you what happened last Saturday
Called all the homies
Said let's hit the town
Five said no
But three were down
We shared half a White Claw
Drank it real quick
Rachel got tired, and she felt real sick
Roll out
It's almost nine
We get to Mel's, and then we hop in the line
Nick's fake didn't work, but that's ok
Because he was heading to the library anyway
Walked in
It was kind of hot
So many people
They were sweating a lot
Feeling scared
They didn't look nice
So we head to Koronet's to grab a quick slice
We talk about class
Discuss midterm three
We realize Josh messed up seven B
He's having a breakdown
GPA's gone bad
He's got to go home to explain to dad
What a wild night
We'll have to do it again
But the best part: we went to bed by ten

Columbia is the best school ever
Columbia kids are kind and clever
We'll stay number one forever
Columbia is the best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
Columbia is the best school ever
Columbia kids are kind and clever
We'll stay number one forever
Columbia is the best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
Best, best, best school ever
